For all of the files provided in this directory I highly suggest 3 things:

1. Start with example 1 and work your way up so that you are able to understand everything going on.

2. Once you look through a file, run it using the command: python name.py

3. Look through the log file that is produced by the example to make sure you understand what is really going on

After you finish looking through the log file please delete it using the command: rm name.log 
This is to make it easy for any one looking through here to follow the logs after running the scripts
Because, as you may not know, log files concatenate each other. 
So name.log may have look confusing for someone not familiar with logging.

Lastly, if you have any questions feel free to ask me and I will attempt to answer them as best as I can.
