# CSCE274

# How to use this
To use this repository, make an account on github if you don't already have one.
Then send me your username and I'll add  you to the repository as a collaborator. You'll also need to download Git.

If you haven't used github from command line before, read this:
https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

Git seems complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it it's really useful. You don't have to do step 1 because I already created the repository on github. Once you get to the "git remote add" step (6), you want to use this URL for the remote repository: 
https://github.com/dallinw/CSCE274.git

Once you have the repository set up, run "git pull" to download the contents of the repository to your computer. You can run the "zCommit.txt" script anytime you finish making changes to code and it will automatically upload your files to Github.

# Actual robot stuff

Here's a demo from some guy online doing something somewhat similar to what we
have to do. His code is in C++ but the examples seem like they might be useful:

"InterfaceExample.txt" is another example, also in C++.
