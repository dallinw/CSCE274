# CSCE274

Hi John and Curtis,

To use this repository, make an account on github if you don't already have one.
Then send me your username and I'll add  you to the repository as a collaborator.

If you haven't used github from command line before, read this:
https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/


You don't have to do step 1 because I already created the repository on github. Once you get to the "git remote add" step (6), you want to use this URL for the remote repository: 
https://github.com/dallinw/CSCE274.git

This will allow you to sync any work you do on your personal computer,
so that it can be shared between all of us.

Here's a demo from some guy online doing something somewhat similar to what we
have to do. His code is in C++ but the examples seem like they might be useful:
