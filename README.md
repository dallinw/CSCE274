# CSCE274

Hi John and Curtis,

Make an account on github if you don't already have one.
Then send me your username and I'll add  you to the repository as a collaborator.

If you haven't used github from command line before, read this:
https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/


You don't have to do step 1 because I already created the repository on github.
You want to use this URL for the remote repository: 
https://github.com/dallinw/CSCE274

This will allow you to sync any work you do on your personal computer,
 so that it can be shared between all of us.
