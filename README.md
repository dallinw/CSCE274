# CSCE274

This repository will contain all the code for four group project assignments programing the iRobot Create 2 using pySerial.

Project 1 involved creating two interfaces which are used to control the state of the robot and send commands. The main.py implements these interfaces to make the robot drive in a pentagon when the "Clean" button is pressed. The robot also listens for button presses as it drives its course and responds by stopping at the next vertex of the pentagon. It then completes the pentagon when the button is pressed again.
